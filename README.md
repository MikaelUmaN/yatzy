# Yatzy

Console based Yatzy game implemented in F#.

Not that well-tested, merely made for fun. Play at your own risk :)!

## TODO

- Create "player" abstraction that can switch between human and computer
- Let human player use the interactive console as is the case now
- Let computer player respond by a function, accepting the entire game state and outputting an action
